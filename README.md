# Sudoku Solver AR

**Sudoku Solver AR** is an augmented reality Sudoku solver. It captures video using a camera, finds Sudoku puzzles in the video, and then displays answers to those puzzles in such a way that they look like they are part of the original scene.

All of the image processing and computer vision code is written from scratch and does not use any external libraries. A series of [blog posts](http://www.codeofview.com/2017/07/20/sudoku-solver-ar-part-1-about/) explain how everything works.
